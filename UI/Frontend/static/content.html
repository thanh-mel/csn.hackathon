                                            <h3>Your Privacy is our Policy</h3>
                                            <p>This policy outlines our obligations in managing personal information we hold about customers, potential customers, contractors and others who come into contact with us and our related companies. We want your
                                                experience with us in both our online and offline environments to be enjoyable and we take care to respect your privacy.</p>
                                            <p>We are bound by the Australian Privacy Principles ('APPs') contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) ('Privacy Act') that require us to handle your personal information responsibly. 'Personal Information' is defined
                                                within the Privacy Act as information or an opinion about an individual, which can be used to identify that individual.</p>
                                            <h3>Why does Trivett collect Personal Information?</h3>
                                            <p>The primary purposes for which we collect your personal information include:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>to provide and market our products and services;</li>
                                                <li>to inform you of special offers and events and to facilitate and process your acceptance order of any special offers, products and services;</li>
                                                <li>to create a better, more personalised experience for you; and</li>
                                                <li>to help us manage and enhance our products and services.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>Generally, we use the information we collect about you for the primary purpose for which it is collected and for reasonably expected secondary purposes. We limit the collection of sensitive information about
                                                customers (e.g. ethnic origin, political opinions, etc.) because, in general, it is not necessary for what we do.</p>
                                            <p>We also takes reasonable steps to provide clear, complete and up-to-date information about our business and the products and services we offer. This includes how to get in touch with us. This information helps
                                                you to make informed choices.</p>
                                            <p>If you do not wish to provide us with personal information, this may result in us being unable to provide you with our products and services, e.g. customer personal information is required by us to register
                                                vehicles; test drives and loan cars are only available to customers who provide personal information and a copy of their driver’s licence; customer personal information is required to ensure that we (and
                                                the vehicle manufacturer) can contact customers for matters relating to vehicle safety and recalls.</p>
                                            <p>If you have a concern with the collection or use of your personal information you can notify us of your concern, make a complaint, obtain redress or pursue dispute resolution by simply contacting the Privacy
                                                Officer using the details set out below.</p>

                                                    to improve our products and services.</li>
                                            </ul>

                                            <p>As much as reasonably possible, we will collect personal information directly from you, although we may from time to time also use external sources that are legally entitled to disclose and use your personal
                                                information.</p>

                                            <p><strong>Electronic Communications</strong></p>
                                            <p>The Spam Act 2003 (Cth) prohibits the sending of commercial electronic communications without the consent of the person to whom the communication is being sent. In line with our commitment to technology (but
                                                within the parameters of the law) we like to accommodate customers who wish to be contacted by way of electronic communications. These communications may be sent for any of the purposes mentioned above.
                                                At the point of collection of personal information we may request the mobile phone number or the email address of our customers. Where customers provide these details, we will also request the consent of
                                                an individual to use these details for commercial electronic communications via SMS and email. Whenever such messages are sent to a customer we will always provide the customer with the option of opting
                                                out of receiving similar communications in the future.</p>
                                            <h3>Do Not Call Register</h3>
                                            <p>The Do Not Call Register Act 2006 prohibits the making of telemarketing calls (as defined in the legislation) to numbers listed on the Do Not Call Register. In line with our commitment to corporate compliance,
                                                we will only contact numbers that appear on the Do Not Call Register in the limited circumstances allowed by the Do Not Call Register Act 2006 and the Telecommunications (Do Not Call Register) (Telemarketing
                                                and Research Calls) Standard 2007, such as where you have given us the requisite consent to do so. Where you give us express consent to contact you by telephone we will deem it to be supplied for an indefinite
                                                period for the purposes of the Do Not Call Register Act 2006, unless otherwise advised or withdrawn by you.</p>
                                            <h3>Opting Out</h3>
                                            <p>We always provide individuals with an opportunity to "opt-out" of receiving direct marketing communications from us. If you have received a direct marketing communication from us and don't wish to receive these
                                                communications from us in the future, just use the "contact us" form on our website or write to or email the Privacy Officer using the details set out below and we will take appropriate steps to ensure your
                                                details are added to our 'Do Not Mail' list to ensure you will not receive any future direct marketing communication from us. We do not send direct marketing communications to customers who have opted out
                                                of receiving such information.</p>
                                            <p>Please note that your details will be retained in the event that we may need to contact you in relation to such matters as vehicle safety, recalls, warranty and for requirements specified by law.</p>

                                            <p>We take all reasonable steps to protect the security of personal information collected by us. We understand that customers require peace of mind when it comes to the security of providing their personal information
                                                to us. We have internal methods to ensure that your personal information is safe and protected against misuse, loss or unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. Where we no longer require your personal
                                                information for a permitted purpose under the APPs, we will take reasonable steps to destroy or suppress your personal information.</p>

                                            <p>The Privacy Officer shall review, investigate and respond to any privacy complaint within 10 working days of receipt of such complaint. The Privacy Officer will advise the complainant if this time frame cannot
                                                be met, usually where the complaint is complex or requires more extensive investigation.</p>

                                            <p>Due to an exemption in the Privacy Act this policy does not apply to our treatment of an employee record, where that treatment is directly related to the current or former employment relationship between us
                                                and the individual.</p>
